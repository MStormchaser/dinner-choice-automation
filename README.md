# What the project does
Welcome to the dinner choice automation. This is a little python programm to automate what to eat for dinner. If you have ever been struggling
with the choice. This might help :-). This project already contains some entries to get started right away. All entries get stored in a csv acting like a database. Just erase them if you would like to add you own. The programm will guide you. 

If you are reading this and are keen to work together and apply this code to a web application to run it on a website. Message me instagram maxmacossa
